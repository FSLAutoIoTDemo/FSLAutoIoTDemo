- The HMTL files are build modularly. Starting only with Navigation, but may look at doing modular tiles later
- Current builds are:
--> FSLfull : The full Auto IoT site, used at FTF2015
--> IBMCotes: Customised site used for IBM Tour de Cotes

- See grunt module 'htmlbuild' in 'tasks/options' folder to configure the HTML builds.
