						<p>Tour des Cols is a group of like minded folks driving all manner of wild machines. We're tracking IMBer Mark Barnard in his 1930's vintage Riley sports car, equipped with Freescale's Automotive IoT kit &amp; IBM's IoT messaging software, on a 10 day journey through the Pyrenees. The route takes in a number of peaks in the Pyrenees, from as far North as San Sebastien right down to Andorra, moving between the French and Spanish border as they go. They should be covering some 300 km per day, so quite a trek with many challenges, technically and mechanically!</p>

						<p>In this site, using Freescale's Automotive Microcontrollers, Arkessa's Connectivity, and IBM's IoT Foundation, Messaging &amp; Bluemix Ecosystem, we demonstrate some live examples of how data generated from from Mark's 1930's 'IoT equipped' Riley could be used in the IoT. <b>Choose a mode above to explore further.</b></p>
